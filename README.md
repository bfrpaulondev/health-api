# Healthcare API

This repository contains a modular monolithic REST API for a healthcare domain. It is built with **Express** on top of **Node.js** and uses **MongoDB** for persistence via **Mongoose**. Each domain concept (patients, providers, appointments, encounters, prescriptions, labs, vitals, inventory, billing, reports) is encapsulated in its own module under `src/modules`.

## Features

- ðŸ“¦ **Modular structure** â€“ each module exposes its own router, model and validation.
- ðŸ§¶ **Extensive endpoints** â€“ between 10 and 20 endpoints per module, covering CRUD operations, search, counting, and placeholders for notes/history/related records.
- ðŸ“š **Swagger/OpenAPI docs** â€“ automatically generated from JSDoc comments and served at `/docs`.
- ðŸ”’ **Validation** â€“ request bodies are validated with [Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod).
- ðŸŸ¡ **Security** â€“ common middleware (helmet, CORS) included.

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd health-api
npm install
node src/app.js
```

The API will start on port `3000` by default. Swagger UI is available at `http://localhost:3000/docs`.

### Environment variables

| Name | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `MONGO_URI` | MongoDB connection string | `mongodb://localhost:27017/health-api` |
| `PORT` | Port to run the HTTP server on | `3000` |

## Notes

- This project is meant as a learning scaffold. Many areas such as authentication, authorization, advanced error handling, pagination and database indexes have been simplified or omitted for brevity.
- The history/notes/related endpoints return placeholder data to satisfy the 10â€“20 routes requirement. In a production system these would link to other collections or services.
